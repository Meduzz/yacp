# Service

## main.go
Let's start with a well known base made up of a Gin. Needless to say it will be a service created in go. Since we will need to collect some data in terms of flags at startup, we need a library able to handle flags at least.

## storage/storage.go
For storage I think we should rely on Badger. By default it should run in memory. But there should be a flag to tell wich file Badger should store its data to. Lets wrap Badger in a service without any functions to start with.

## controller/routes.go
Lets start out with a setup like function that accept a Gin engine and creates our routes.

### GET /
We will need an index page that people land on when the visit our site. For now we can define it without handler. But lets define the endpoint so we dont forget it.

### POST /chat
We will need an endpoint that we can post our chats to. It too can be without handler initially. But lets define the endpoint so we dont forget about it.

## chat/service.go
In the first iteration my plan is that we only support Ollama. By default we should try to connect to localhost, but there should be a flag to point this module towards another host too. Lets wrap this logic in a service. In this first iteration there will be no function in this service.

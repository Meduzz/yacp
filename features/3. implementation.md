# Implementation

Here I decided not to use any llm to help me out. Partly because I had to try my way forward but also because I remembered how much it struggled with these "unknown" frameworks before.

## Result

Almost as bad as the llm. I changed a few urls, added others. Implemented the lot. Added a silly system prompt.
